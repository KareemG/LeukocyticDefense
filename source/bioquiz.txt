1. White blood cells are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.
True
Post Answer: That is why the currency in the game is in bone marrow points.
2. Eosinophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell.
False
Post Answer: Neutrophils are! They make up 58% of your white blood cell count.
3. The lifespan of an activated neutrophil in a human is 1-2 days.
True
Post Answer: Be sure to replenish your neutrophils!
4. Neutrophils are usually first white blood cells to attack pathogens.
True
Post Answer: That is why they have one of the longest ranges in our game!
5. The body has more red blood cells than white blood cells.
False
Post Answer: This is only true in the bloodstream. There are many non-activated WBCs!
6. 10% of circulating white blood cells are Basophils. 
False
Post Answer: They are very rare--Only 1% of Basophils are circulating in our bloodstream normally!
7. The maturation stage of Eosinophil white blood cells is 8 hours.
False
Post Answer: They require 8 days, not hours!
8. Eosinophil cells can trap substances.
True
Post Answer: Don't estimate their strength in Leukocytic defense!
9. T Cells participate in immediate allergic reactions.
False
Post Answer: This is the role of an eosinophil cell!
10. Eosinophil cells do not modulate inflammatory responses.
False
Post Answer: This is one of eosinophil cells' roles!
11. Are Eosinophils linked with permanent pathologic diseases.
True
Post Answer: Examples are: Loeffler’s disease and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.
12. Helper T Cells assist other white blood cells in immunologic processes.
True
Post Answer: This is why T Cells in our game increase the surrounding white blood cells' damages.
13. Asthma is a cause of a spike in the Basophil population
True
Post Answer: Basophils also spike up in population due to the immune system at risk too!
14. Natural Killer Cells are critically important cells to the innate immune system.
True
Post Answer: They are expensive but quarantine enemy pathogens very well!
15. One of the functions of Eosinophils is to target parasites.
True
Post Answer: Because of this, Eosinophils quarantine parasites faster in the game!
16. Natural Killer cells naturally seek out pathogens.
True
Post Answer: This is why they have one of the largest damages in the game!
17. Eosinophils make up around 20% of the white blood cells in your body.
False
Post Answer: They only make up around 2%! Very small when compared to Neutrophils.
18. Once created, all white blood cells enter the bloodstream and start working.
False
Post Answer: White blood cells can remain in lymph nodes until called upon or ready to be sent out.
